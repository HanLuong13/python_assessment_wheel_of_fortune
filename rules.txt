rules: 
-start with 3 players, 2 rounds (third round is bonus round)
-beginning of round, the word is diplayed, randomly picked player goes first

-a turn for a player
    -they can 1. buy a vowel, 2. spin the wheel to guess a consenant, 3. guess a consenant or 4.guess the word
        -1. buy a vowel
            -if they want to buy a vowel, they must have more than $250 in their bank, they have to re-choose
            -if vowel is not in word, they lose 250 and their turn ends
            -if vowel is in word, they lose 250 and continues turn
        -2. spin the wheel to guess a consenant
            -spin the wheel 
                -if they land on bankruptcy they lose $ for that round and their turn ends
                -if they land on lose a turn, they get the $ for that round and their turn ends
                -if they land on free spin, they get an extra spin at the end of their turn
                -if they land on $, they guess a consenant 
            -guessing a consenant
                -if consenant is in word, count how many times <x>, they get <x> times current spin money and their turn continues
                -if consenant is not in word, they get the $ for that round and their turn ends
        -3. guess a consenant
                -if there's a current spin money, they can go
                -if there isn't, they have to re-choose
        -4. guess the word
                -if they guess word right, they get the $ for that round and the round ends
                -if they guessed the wrond word, they get the $ for that round and their turn ends

-when a turn ends, the next chronological player goes
-when round 1 ends, round 2 begins, round 2 is exact of round 1
-when round 2 ends, bonus round begins, player with most in their bank is the only player
-bonus round
    -word is displayed with R-S-T-L-N-E revealed
    -player gets to guess 3 consenants and 1 vowel, no cost
    -once they make their guess, those consenants and vowel are revealed
    -they have 5 seconds to guess word
        -if timer runs out, they lost
        -if guessed wrong, they lost
        -if guessed right, they win the money in their bank and a prize
